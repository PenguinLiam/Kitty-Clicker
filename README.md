# Kitty-Clicker
this is my first pygame so please no judging

On Liclipse, after an edit has been made online, you have to fetch the remote.
After this you have to merge the two branches:
  - go into local (in repositories tab, branches, local, master)
  - right click maste
  - merge
  - double click under remote tracking on origin/master
  - then you are done and okay to work on the files
